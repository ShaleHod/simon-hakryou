# Exercise 2
1. create 3 parameters:
    a. val1 that equals 10
    b. val2 that equals 20
    c. val3 that equals "10"
2. create an if else statement that checks if val1 is equal to val2 and displays a message
3. create an if else statement that checks if val1 is equal to val3 and displays a message.
4. check the same condition in 3. but using a '==' condition check.
5. create an if that checks if val1 is bigger than val2
6. change the value of val1 and see what changes.
7. create a parameter and set its value using the ternary condition (?:)

## loops
1. create a for loop that runs from 2-8 and prints out a line "Im line #" (replace # with the loop index)
2. create a for loop that runs from 20-5 in jumps of 5 and prints out a line "Im line #" (replace # with the loop index)
3. create a loop that loops 100 times and prints out:
    a. 'fizz' for indexes that divide by 3 (no left over)
    b. 'buzz' for indexes that divide by 5 (no left over)
    c. 'fizzbuzz' for indexes that divide by 5 and 3 (no left over)
    d. for all other indexes just print the number
