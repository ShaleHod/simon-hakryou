# HomeWork 2
1. Build a function that takes an array
2. The function needs to return the array BUT sorted
3. The array will contain only numbers
4. Do not use the sort function!!
5. Hint... Bubble Sort
6. Another Hint you will need 2 loops, one inside the other
7. Bonus... Try and use splice

[64,34,25,12,22,11,90]
[100,20,-10,-25,0,990]

Example:
IN        OUT
[3,1,2] - [1,2,3]
